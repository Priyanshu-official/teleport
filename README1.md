# Teleport - A simplified POSTMAN clone

## A simplified POSTMAN clone with response differ and hyper runs

> In response to numerous feedbacks, I have already started working on Phase 2. I will bring the key checker switch and hyper run "live" soon.

This is not only a simplified POSTMAN close built with **react**, but also an example of a more customizable, personalized alternative to POSTMAN.

## Working application

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been working with React for about four years. I built cool stuff at [Github](https://github.com/Rajdeepc) and so I wanted to try out to build another cool alternative to POSTMAN with bunch of new features for developers and testers.

This is a showcase application I've built in my spare time to experiment the power of React that I wanted to try before: `React`, `NodeJS`, `IndexDB`.

There are not many alternative to REST client applications like POSTMAN on the web and I think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to **React developers of all skill levels** while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

---

This piece of application is a long term release of new features which can be seen in the Release notes which I am planning to push every month. The product will be live soon for production use.

### Phase 2

> July 10 - 25, 2020

- [ ] Refactor the mono repo to use Nx Workspace
- [ ] GraphQL API and store data on the actual database
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Websocket realtime update
- [ ] Interactive report

## Time spending

It is a side project that I only spent time outside of the office hours to work on.

I have spent about 80 hours working on this project. Which is equivalent to watch the whole Stranger Things series twice.


## What's currently missing?

There are missing features from the live demo which should exist in a real product. All of them will be finished on Phase 2:

### Import JSON collection
I would like to build this feature for a robust JSON parser which can import and parse any type of JSON

### Diff checker for testers and developers
This feature will hold a switch which will enable diff checker for attribute for testers and the value for developers. This could make a good feature for testers to check for any changes in attribute of the current response


### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/Rajdeepc/teleport.git`
- `cd teleport`
- `npm run start` for the API
- The API server should run on `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

Unit Testing done with React Testing Library.

## Compatibility

It was being tested on IE 11, Chrome and Firefox. For Safari, there are some minor alignment issues.
