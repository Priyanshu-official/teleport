This is not only a simplified POSTMAN close built with **react**, but also an example of a more customizable, personalized alternative to POSTMAN.

## Working application

Check out the **live demo** -> https://lintrest.herokuapp.com


If you like my work, feel free to:

- :star: this repository. And I will be happy together :)

Thanks a bunch for stopping by and supporting me!

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been working with React for about four years. I built cool stuff at [Github](https://github.com/Rajdeepc) and so I wanted to try out to build a cool alternative to POSTMAN with bunch of new features for **developers** and **testers**.

This is a showcase application I've built in my spare time to experiment the power of React that I wanted to try before: `React`, `NodeJS`, `IndexDB`.

I think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to **React developers of all skill levels** while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

---

This piece of application is a long term release of new features which can be seen in the Release notes which I am planning to push every month. The product will be live soon for production use.

## Usage üí°

1. Choose `method`
2. Enter `URL`
3. Send request
4. Get response

## Built with üîß

- HTML - For the web framework
- SASS - For styling components
- JavaScript - The Engine
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org/)


## Features and Roadmap

I set the tentative deadline for motivating myself to finish the work on time. Otherwise, It will take forever to complete :)

### Phase 1 - MERN application with IndexDB and SSO support

> June Release, 2020

- [x] Compare Response Feature - Compare responses of the same API once response structure changes
- [x] Add or remove API Endpoints - Add and remove API endpoints from EndPoints tab
- [x] Search Endpoints - Search through your API Endpoints with Smart Search
- [x] Sign In Feature - Sign In to save all your api
- [x] Notification Swtich - Switch On/Off Notifications
- [x] Generate Code - Generate Code from your API constructs
- [x] More Personalized Settings - More Personalised Settings Feature
- [x] IndexDB Support - Localized data now saved in IndexDB for more storage

### Phase 2

> Sept Release, 2020

- [x] Refactor the repo with TypeScript
- [x] Authentication with custom sign up
- [x] Websocket realtime update on Notifications
- [x] Difference checker switch to show attribute or values
- [x] Automation in documentation generator of APIs

## Time spending

It is a side project that I only spent time outside of the office hours to work on.

I have spent about 80 hours working on this project which is equivalent to watching the whole Stranger Things series twice.


## What's currently missing?

There are missing features from the live demo which should exist in a real product. All of them will be finished on Phase 2:

### Import JSON collection

I would like to build this feature for a robust JSON parser which can import and parse any type of JSON

### Diff checker for testers and developers

This feature will hold a switch which will enable diff checker for attribute for testers and the value for developers. This could make a good feature for testers to check for any changes in attribute of the current response


### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/Rajdeepc/teleport.git`
- `cd teleport`
- `npm run start` for the API
- The API server should run on `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

Unit Testing done with React Testing Library.

## Compatibility

It was being tested on IE 11, Chrome and Firefox. For Safari, there are some minor alignment issues.
